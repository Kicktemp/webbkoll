# Webbkoll

This is the code that powers https://webbkoll.dataskydd.net â€“ an
online tool that checks how a webpage is doing with regards to privacy.

It attempts to simulate what happens when a user visits a specified page
with a typical browser without clicking on anything, with the
browser having no particular extensions installed, and with Do Not Track
(DNT) disabled (as this is the default setting in most browsers).

In short: this tool, which runs the user-facing web service (built with
[Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) and [Phoenix](http://phoenixframework.org/)),
asks a [PhearJS](https://github.com/Tomtomgo/phearjs) server to visit a page
using [PhantomJS](https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs). PhearJS/PhantomJS
visits and renders the page, collects various data (requests made, cookies,
response headers, etc.), and sends it back as JSON to this tool which
then analyzes the data and presents the results on a webpage along with
explanations and advice.

Webbkoll is multilingual and currently supports English and Swedish.

[Jumbo](https://github.com/mspanc/jumbo) is used for job processing, and
some basic rate limiting is done with [ex_rated](https://github.com/grempe/ex_rated).
Multiple PhearJS backends can be configured. [ConCache](https://github.com/sasa1977/con_cache)
is used to store results in an in-memory [ETS](http://erlang.org/doc/man/ets.html) table
for a limited time. Other than PhearJS, there are no external dependencies, and nothing is
saved to disk.

**Please note** that this is still a work in progress. Expect bugs and
messy code in places. Only a few basic tests are in place.

**Also note** that this tool is mainly meant to be used as a _starting point_
for web developers. For more rigorous and systematic testing we
recommend that you check out [OpenWPM](https://github.com/citp/OpenWPM),
which we used to analyze the websites of Sweden's municipalities
([site](https://dataskydd.net/kommuner/), [code](https://github.com/andersju/municipality-privacy)).
You might also want to have a look at [PrivacyScore](https://privacyscore.org/),
which is a bit more comprehensive than Webbkoll (additionally checks e.g. email and TLS/SSL
configuration) and also lets you compare/rank lists of sites.

This is a project by [Dataskydd.net](https://dataskydd.net). We received initial funding from
[Internetfonden](https://www.internetfonden.se/) / [IIS](https://www.iis.se) (The Internet Foundation in Sweden).

## Backend

Get PhearJS running - see https://github.com/Tomtomgo/phearjs/blob/master/README.md.

## Frontend (this app!)

Install Erlang (>= 20) and Elixir (>= 1.4) -- see http://elixir-lang.org/install.html.

Clone this repository, cd into it.

Install dependencies:

```
mix deps.get
```

Make sure PhearJS is running on the host/port specified in `config/dev.exs`

Download the [GeoLite2 country database](https://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geoip2/geolite2/) in MaxMind DB binary format, extract it, and make sure it's available as `priv/GeoLite2-Country.mmdb` (or as specified in `config/config.exs`). (All you need to keep it fresh is [geoipupdate](https://github.com/maxmind/geoipupdate); Webbkoll reloads the database at certain intervals, see `config/config.exs`.)

Compile CSS with sassc and copy static assets (this replaces brunch and 340 node dependencies):

```
mkdir -p priv/static/css priv/static/fonts priv/static/images priv/static/js
sassc --style compressed assets/scss/style.scss priv/static/css/app.css
rsync -av assets/static/*  priv/static
```

Start the Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` (or to get an interactive shell: `iex -S mix phx.server`)

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) in your browser.

### Production

To run in production, get and compile dependencies:

```
mix deps.get --only prod
MIX_ENV=prod mix compile
```

Do the compile CSS/rsync files step from above, and then digest and compress static files:

```
MIX_ENV=prod mix phx.digest
```

Start the server in the foreground (port must be specified):

```
MIX_ENV=prod PORT=4001 mix phx.server
```

Or detached:

```
MIX_ENV=prod PORT=4001 elixir --detached -S mix phx.server
```

Or in an interactive shell:

```
MIX_ENV=prod PORT=4001 iex -S mix phx.server
```

See also the official [Phoenix deployment guides](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/deployment.html).

### Keeping PhearJS running

To make sure PhearJS keeps running, you might want to use supervisord and a `/etc/supervisor/conf.d/phearjs.conf` like this:

```
[program:phearjs]
command=/usr/bin/nodejs /home/foobar/phearjs/phear.js
autostart=true
autorestart=true
stderr_logfile=/home/foobar/phearjs/err.log
stdout_logfile=/home/foobar/phearjs/out.log
user=foobar
environment=HOME="/home/foobar",USER="foobar"
directory=/home/foobar/phearjs
```

## TODO/ideas
  * **Switch from PhantomJS to headless Chrome ([Puppeteer](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer))**
  * Add more suggestions for privacy-friendly alternatives to popular services
  * Optionally visit a number of randomly selected internal pages and let the results be based on the collective data from all the pages
  * Availability over Tor (e.g. does the visitor have to solve a Cloudflare captcha?)
  * HTTPS Everywhere: check for requests that _could_ have been secure
  * Check localStorage (Web Storage)
  * SSL Labs integration (or testssl.sh?)
  * DNSSEC?
  * IPv6 support
  * Check whether site is in HSTS preload list?
  * More translations?
  * More? Let me know!
