## Translating Webbkoll

You are very welcome to help us translate Webbkoll to languages other than English/Swedish.

For this purpose we have an online translation service running Weblate on https://weblate.dataskydd.net/,
where you can create an account and start translating.

The base language is English. Languages currently available for translation are:

* French
* German
* Swedish (this one we handle ourselves)

If you wish to add another language, or if you have any issues, just email us at info@dataskydd.net.
